# Hybrid\\Breadcrumbs

Hybrid Breadcrumbs is a drop-in package that theme authors can use to add breadcrumbs to their WordPress themes.

The package is a developer-friendly project that aims to take out all the work of handling breadcrumbs. It is one of the most advanced and robust breadcrumb systems available that can handle nearly any setup to show the most accurate breadcrumbs for each page.

This project was [originally launched in 2009](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/04/05/breadcrumb-trail-wordpress-plugin) as the Breadcrumb Trail plugin. Hybrid Breadcrumbs is a reimagining of that original script as a better drop-in package for theme authors to use.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6+ (preferably 7+)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing PHP dependencies.

Technically, you could make this work without Composer by directly downloading and dropping the package into your theme.  However, using Composer is ideal and the supported method for using this project.

## Documentation

The following docs are written with theme authors in mind because that'll be the most common use case.  If including in a plugin, it shouldn't be much different.

### Installation

First, you'll need to open your command line tool and change directories to your theme folder.

```bash
cd path/to/wp-content/themes/<your-theme-name>
```

Then, use Composer to install the package.

```bash
composer require justintadlock/hybrid-breadcrumbs
```

Assuming you're not already including the Composer autoload file for your theme and are shipping this as part of your theme package, you'll want something like the following bit of code in your theme's `functions.php` to autoload this package (and any others).

The Composer autoload file will automatically load up Hybrid Breadcrumbs for you and make its code available for you to use.

```php
if ( file_exists( get_parent_theme_file_path( 'vendor/autoload.php' ) ) ) {
	require_once( get_parent_theme_file_path( 'vendor/autoload.php' ) );
}
```

### Translations

Because this script has a few internationalized text strings within it, you'll want to overwrite the textdomain or use something like this [one theme with two textdomains trick](https://gist.github.com/justintadlock/7a605c29ae26c80878d0) (the textdomain in this project is `'hybrid-core'`).

If you're creating a theme using the [Hybrid Core framework](https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core), you don't have to worry about this. Hybrid Core will appropriately handle translations for you.

### Usage

Hybrid Breadcrumbs has a few functions, but the primary function that you'll want to use is `display()`. Typically, this would go into something like your theme's `header.php` template but can be used anywhere you want to show the breadcrumb trail.  The function call would look like this:

```
<?php Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\display() ?>
```

_Note that the plugin's namespace is `Hybrid\Breadcrumbs`.  If you're working within another namespace, you'll want to add a `use` statement after your own namespace call or call `\Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\display()` directly.  I'll assume you know what you're doing if you're working with namespaces.  Otherwise, stick to the above._

### Functions

All of the primary functions you might use follow the same parameter pattern (see parameters below).  Of course, all of these functions are under the `Hybrid\Breadcrumbs` namespace.

```php
// Returns a new instance of the Breadcrumbs class.
breadcrumbs( array $args = [] );

// Makes a new breadcrumbs object and returns it.
make( array $args = [] );

// Returns an array of Crumb objects.
all( array $args = [] );

// Renders the HTML output of the breadcrumb trail if it exists.
display( array $args = [] );

// Returns the HTML output of the breadcrumb trail or an empty string.
render( array $args = [] );
```

### Static class

If you prefer to work with static classes instead of functions, you can use the `Hybrid\Breadcrumbs\Util\Trail` class.

```php
// Returns a new instance of the Breadcrumbs class.
Trail::breadcrumbs( array $args = [] );

// Makes a new breadcrumbs object and returns it.
Trail::make( array $args = [] );

// Returns an array of Crumb objects.
Trail::all( array $args = [] );

// Renders the HTML output of the breadcrumb trail if it exists.
Trail::display( array $args = [] );

// Returns the HTML output of the breadcrumb trail or an empty string.
Trail::render( array $args = [] );
```

### Parameters

The function accepts an single parameter, which an array of optional arguments for setting up the breadcrumb trail.  The following is a list of all the available options (see below for defaults).

* `labels` - An array of labels.

```

#### Default Post Taxonomies

By default, no post taxonomies are registered.  However, if a site's post permalink structure is set to only `%postname%`, the following will be the default.

```php
$defaults = [
	'post' => 'category'
];
```
